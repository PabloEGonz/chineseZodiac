    <h1>Chinese Zodiac Animal Signs</h1>
<div  id="headerp">
    <p>This is a webpage that tells you what Chinese Zodiacs sign you are, you have to enter your date of birth and it will show your zodiac animal.</p>
    <p>The Chinese zodiac, or Sheng Xiao (生肖), is a repeating 12-year cycle of animal signs and their ascribed attributes, based on the lunar calendar. In order, the zodiac animals are: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig.</p>
    <p>Your birth year determines your Chinese zodiac sign, but it can get tricky, as the lunar calendar varies from the solar, or Gregorian, calendar.</p>
    <p>Because the dates of Chinese New Year change every year, individuals born in January or February will need to pay special attention to their birth date in addition to their birth year.</p>
