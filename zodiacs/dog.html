      Personality: Dogs are honest, loyal, reliable, and quick-witted.

      <p>
        The biggest characteristics of Dogs are loyalty and honesty. In fact,
        Dog people are cautious by nature, which means it may take a comparably
        long time for Dogs to accept new friends. However, once Dogs accept a
        friend, they will be very loyal to the friends and always be supportive.
        Dogs are loyal friends, honest lovers and reliable families.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though being just and honest, Dogs are also very critical and sometimes
        make a sharp criticism. They are not good at taking the whole picture to
        consider things, which may lead to misunderstanding and blame their own
        mistakes on others.
