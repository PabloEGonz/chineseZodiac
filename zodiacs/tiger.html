      <p>
        With the uncommon courage and confidence, people born in the Year of the
        Tiger are natural leaders and they can always bravely put brilliant
        ideas into practice. They are also generous, passionate and holding a
        strong sense of justice. When meeting the weak or see anything unfair,
        the Tigers stand up and offer help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tigers are such persons who dare to love and hate. If a friend does
        something wrong, they may point it out directly. The daring also makes
        them rebellious, stubborn and arbitrary in life, and thus it is not easy
        for them to take othersâ€™ advice.
