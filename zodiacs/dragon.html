        Most people born in the Year of the Dragon are full of fighting spirit
        and strength. They are charismatic, attracting a lot of followers and
        their talented leadership skills naturally convince every subordinate.
        The Dragons may look indifferent, however, they actually are chivalrous
        and always think of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Dragonâ€™s pride may bring prejudice, and it is also a little hard
        for them to have the force of will to follow through. If they want to
        achieve excellence and get great success, then honing the willpower is
        indispensable.
