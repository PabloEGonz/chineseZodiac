    <h1>Year of the Dragon</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>Most people born in the Year of the Dragon are full of fighting spirit and strength. They are charismatic, attracting a lot of followers and their talented leadership skills naturally convince every subordinate. The Dragons may look indifferent, however, they actually are chivalrous and always think of others.</p>
    <p>But the Dragonâ€™s pride may bring prejudice, and it is also a little hard for them to have the force of will to follow through. If they want to achieve excellence and get great success, then honing the willpower is indispensable.</p>
