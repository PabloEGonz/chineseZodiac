    <h1>Year of the Ox</h1>
    <h3>Personality: Oxen are faithful, obliging, persistent, and sympathetic.</h3>
    <p>The faithful character of people with Chinese zodiac Ox sign helps them to get trust from the leaders and friends. They also have talents to be leaders and are good at managing, but maybe a little strict. Oxen like routines and respect traditional ideas, doing things step by step. The persistence makes most of them become tireless workers.</p>
    <p>They are likely to be self-made and insist that everyone should do their part while not putting up barriers to others' work. Although being a little conservative, Oxen always try to keep just and fair, no matter in life or at work, and never let people down.</p>
