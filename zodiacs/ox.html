      Personality: Oxen are faithful, obliging, persistent, and sympathetic.
    </h3>

      <p>
        The faithful character of people with Chinese zodiac Ox sign helps them
        to get trust from the leaders and friends. They also have talents to be
        leaders and are good at managing, but maybe a little strict. Oxen like
        routines and respect traditional ideas, doing things step by step. The
        persistence makes most of them become tireless workers.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are likely to be self-made and insist that everyone should do their
        part while not putting up barriers to others' work. Although being a
        little conservative, Oxen always try to keep just and fair, no matter in
        life or at work, and never let people down.
