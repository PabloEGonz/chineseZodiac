      <p>
        People born in the Year of the Pig are always diligent and upright and
        never to be pretentious. Thus Pigs are easy to get othersâ€™ trust. Their
        compassionate and genuine personality make them glad to offer others a
        hand at any time, which results in getting a lot of good friends. The
        strong sense of responsibility also makes Pig people spare no pains at
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pigs may be a little realistic and emotional, and it is hard for them to
        detect lies and thus easily be fooled by bad people.
