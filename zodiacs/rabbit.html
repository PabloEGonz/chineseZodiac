    <h1>Year of the Rabbit</h1>
    <h3>
      Personality: Rabbits are are gentle, elegant, self-disciplined, and alert.
    </h3>
    <p>
      People born in the years of the Rabbit tend to have some characteristics
      of the real rabbits which are quiet at most times but also acted swiftly
      when needed. Generally, the Rabbits are positive, gentle and elegant. They
      love freedom, but once set goals, they just march forward for it without
      distractions. They are also self-disciplined, the typical kind of people
      who are strict with themselves but tolerant of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though looking mild and soft, the Rabbits in fact are alert to strangers
      and outsiders. They donâ€™t trust others easily, unlikely to be fooled by
      others. However, they do have courteous manners in social settings.
