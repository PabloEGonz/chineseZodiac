    <h1>Year of the Rat</h1>
    <h3>
      Personality: Rats are smart, quick-witted, strong-willed, and ambitious.
    </h3>
    <p>
      People who were born in the Year of the Rat are always called Rats whose
      characteristics tend to be more quick-witted with a keen observation and
      foresight. Rats also have a bright and optimistic personality which makes
      them adapt to changes in any environment and easily get help from others.
      However, though Rats are ambitious in career, they may not be qualified to
      become great leaders due to the stubbornness and the lack of empathy and
      humility.
