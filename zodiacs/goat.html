      <p>
        Among all the 12 Chinese zodiacs, the Sheep is the most gentle and soft
        one. The mild sheep seldom lose their temper to others or become very
        aggressive. They care about others’ feelings and never intend to hurt
        people. Their upright personality also makes them sympathetic enough to
        understand other people’s problems from various perspectives, especially
        for their friends and loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, sometimes they can be very passive and tend to be a pessimist
        to see bad aspects of things, which means that they need strong support
        and enough understanding from their friends. Also, they keep alert when
        strangers step into their domains.
