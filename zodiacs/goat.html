    <h1>Year of the Goat</h1>
    <h3>Personality: Sheep are gentle, calm, upright, and sympathetic.</h3>
    <p>
      Among all the 12 Chinese zodiacs, the Sheep is the most gentle and soft
      one. The mild sheep seldom lose their temper to others or become very
      aggressive. They care about others’ feelings and never intend to hurt
      people. Their upright personality also makes them sympathetic enough to
      understand other people’s problems from various perspectives, especially
      for their friends and loved ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, sometimes they can be very passive and tend to be a pessimist to
      see bad aspects of things, which means that they need strong support and
      enough understanding from their friends. Also, they keep alert when
      strangers step into their domains.
