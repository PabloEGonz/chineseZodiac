    <h1>Year of the Goat</h1>
    <h3>Personality: Sheep are gentle, calm, upright, and sympathetic.</h3>
    <p>Among all the 12 Chinese zodiacs, the Sheep is the most gentle and soft one. The mild sheep seldom lose their temper to others or become very aggressive. They care about others’ feelings and never intend to hurt people. Their upright personality also makes them sympathetic enough to understand other people’s problems from various perspectives, especially for their friends and loved ones.</p>
    <p>However, sometimes they can be very passive and tend to be a pessimist to see bad aspects of things, which means that they need strong support and enough understanding from their friends. Also, they keep alert when strangers step into their domains.</p>
