    <h1>Year of the Monkey</h1>
    <h3>Personality: Monkeys are lively, clever, agile, competitive, and sociable.</h3>
    <p>People with the Chinese zodiac monkey sign are born to have brilliant minds. They are not only intelligent, smart and always appreciated by teachers and parents throughout adolescence but also have strong bodies, all of which make them perform well in an organization and they tend to be excellent leaders than anyone else. At work, they show initiative and hold the courage to face new challenges. At life, they are helpful and humorous enough to be favored by people.</p>
    <p>However, boasting may hinder them to make great success and they need more patience. Too many opportunistic behaviors may also affect othersâ€™ impressions on them.</p>
