      Personality: Horses are cheerful, enthusiastic, insightful, and
      considerate.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Compared to other zodiac signs, people with Chinese zodiac Horse sign are
      more lively, energetic, courageous, and enthusiastic about people and
      life. However, they are not good at hiding emotions and their feelings
      will be easily shown on the face. But that doesn’t affect their great
      popularity among people, and no wonder that most of them are fond of
      joining social activities.

      Another character of the Horse is that they do have a keen eye and display
      strong logical thinking, which makes them easily discover the essence
      through the phenomena and be considerate enough to take care of other
      people’s emotions.
