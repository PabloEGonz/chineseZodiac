      <p>
        By virtue of their outing personality, people with Chinese zodiac
        Rooster sign are good at making friends or adjusting themselves into a
        new environment. Whenever there is a tricky problem, they will not give
        up easily but try every means to solve it. Since they cannot stand
        lagging behind others, self-improving is an important part of their
        life.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as the name implies, Rooster people tend to be cocky or even
        arrogant sometimes. Their craving for attention may make others feel
        uncomfortable. The lack of patience could be another problem.
