          Dog people are cautious by nature, which means it may take a comparably

          friend, they will be very loyal to the friends and always be supportive.
          Dogs are loyal friends, honest lovers and reliable families.//
          Though being just and honest, Dogs are also very critical and sometimes
          make a sharp criticism. They are not good at taking the whole picture to
          consider things, which may lead to misunderstanding and blame their own
